The steps in this exercise file, assume that the Docker Engine is already
installed.

Determine container's process is privileged
===========================================

On the host:

$ docker container run -it --name foo alpine sh

In the container, check the user associated with PID 1 is 'root':

$ ps

Detach from the container using <CTRL-p><CTRL-q> sequence, and then verify that
the container's process is running as the 'root' user:

$ docker container top foo -eo user,pid,comm

Remove the container:

$ docker container rm -f foo

Configure the daemon for user namespaces
========================================

Familiarize yourself with the contents of the user subordinate file:

$ cat /etc/subuid

Edit the daemon's configuration file, at /etc/docker/daemon.json (create it, if
necessary), and add the following line to the body of the JSON object:

"userns-remap": "default"

Restart the Docker daemon:

$ sudo systemctl restart docker.service

Verify that the user 'dockremap' has an entry in the subordinate file:

$ cat /etc/subuid

Determine container's process is non-privileged
===============================================

On the host:

$ docker container run -it --name foo alpine sh

In the container, check the user associated with PID 1 is 'root':

$ ps

Detach from the container using <CTRL-p><CTRL-q> sequence, and then verify that
the container's process is running as the user with the UID at the top of the
subordinate range:

$ docker container top foo -eo user,pid,comm

View new sub-directory in the data root
=======================================

$ sudo ls -l /var/lib/docker
